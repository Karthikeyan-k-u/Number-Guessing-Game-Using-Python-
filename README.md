In this game, the computer secretly selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player gets 10 attempts to guess the correct number. It creates an exciting challenge where each guess brings you closer to winning.

After every attempt, the game provides helpful feedback such as “Too High” or “Too Low,” guiding the player toward the correct answer. This makes the experience engaging and encourages logical thinking. Players also have the freedom to quit the game anytime by typing end, making it user-friendly and flexible.

This project is simple yet powerful because it demonstrates important programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation. It is a great mini-project for anyone who wants to strengthen their Python basics while building something enjoyable and interactive.
